This is a smartthings device handler for the Xiaomi Aqara wired wall switch with no neutral connection. 
This version should work with the single switch versions, QBKG04LM and QBKG21LM, and the 2 switch vwersiona, QBKG03LM and GBKG22LM.
It is based on work by @simic and @wastedabuser. 
In the 2 switch version, only one of the 2 switches is required to be connected to the live + switched wire.  
The other may be used as a soft switch.
The device will also give the temperature (in integer degrees).
The device responds to simple presses of the switch and to press and hold.  
It does not distinguish between double press and press & hold.
The additional attribute 'lastPressType' takes the values 'soft', 'hard', 'double', 'held', 'refresh', 
indicating the type of the last switching event.
'double' indicates that both switches were pressed simulataneously.  
'refresh' indicates that the 'refresh' icon in the app was pressed. 

The unwired switch is treated as a button, which can be used in conjunction with (e.g.) ABC (Advanced Button Controller).  
In this case ABC sees it as 'button 1'.
If both switches are pressed simultaneously, ABC will see 'button 2' as pressed.

SmartThings does not cope well with devices with more than one 'endpoint', such as a double switch.  
However, this DH works well in connection with @erocm1231's 'Virtual Device Sync' app, 
which is designed to overcome this limitation.

I have included a preference for initialising this to 'None', 'Left', or 'Right'.  
The single switch version should leave this set to 'None'.   

The latest version of the DH works with the new Samsung SmartThings App as well as with the Classic App.   
However, the interface within the new App still needs some work.
